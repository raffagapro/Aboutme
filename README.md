<h2>ABOUT MEðŸŒ±</h2>
<p><em>As a problem solver who loves facing challenges in my work, I'm excited to work as a web developer. Every challenge is a new puzzle to be solved. I'm passionate about new technologies like React, Express, and many others. I am ambitious about my work, and love to be on a team that questions possibilities. I am, also, well organized, goal-oriented, and an autonomous learner, that loves to discover and learn. Personal growth is a core value of mine. I have four years of experience freelancing for many teams, in many projects and in a wide variety of technologies, from mobile app development to robust web CMRs applications.</br>
